ENCRYCPTION

When encryption is implemented, exchange is as follows:

Client generates a key using random (seed with client nanotime?)
Key is RSA-encryped using pubkey, and sent in a handshake.
Both connection managers immediately activate encryption. 
Channel is now secured by stream cypher.
Further encryption can be implemented by changing the constants. 

Server sends a new key randomly in the encrypted channel.
