ARCHITECTURE - Client



Magma and Ember are good names

Client (/engine) - initialises low-level graphics, window, frame etc.

Threading model now initialises?
Threaded tasks update the progress, status whilst second thread draws 30fps?
When initial loading done, initial loading thread system is cleared, "gamethreading"/linked threads/framesynced
