Security improvements and notes:

For stream algorithm the first data sent must be random to prevent guessing the key. 
The client should, in the RSA block, specify X packets to disregard and then send them. 

Authoritative commands (update, offline etc) by RSA?
Serv->isaac seed enc with pubkey. Target decrypts and sends OK enc with isaac seed.
Server only accepts if OK returned, else kicks, logs, warns.
