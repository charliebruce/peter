To transform the normal to eye space we will use the pre-defined uniform variable mat3 gl_NormalMatrix. This matrix is the transpose of the inverse of the 3×3 upper left sub matrix from the modelview matrix. We will do the normal transformation per vertex. T

Optimization: Stencil Cull Two pass algorithm, but first pass is very cheap Rendering without color writes = 2x pixels per clock 1.Render light volume with color write disabled Depth Func = LESS, Stencil Func = ALWAYS
Stencil Z-FAIL = REPLACE (with value X)
Rest of stencil ops set to KEEP
2.Render with lighting shader Depth Func = ALWAY, Stencil Func = EQUAL, all ops = KEEP, Stencil Ref = X Unlit pixels will be culled because stencil will not match the reference value








Bokeh blur dof! gorgheous

That's how Bokeh works in Unreal / Unity / CryEngine 3 / Just Cause 2 or any other game with the effect. Creates a quad for each emissive out of focus area and applies the Bokeh sprite with an average colour sample.

Garry is working on a SuperDOF Bokeh system, which could be used along with a script to make SuperDOF render every frame. 


For each screen pixel, we render a quad/sprite. This sprite size is scaled based on a factor of how much of the pixel is in focus or out of focus (commonly denominated as Circle of Confusion). Such sprites can also feature a mask approximating the camera aperture shape.
Unfortunately, the graphics hardware is still a few years away from being able to efficiently use such techniques at full screen resolution. Thus, this implementation is done at half resolution and includes a number of additional optimizations. One of the main advantages of this approach is the ability for arbitrary large defocus amount, without under sampling.
